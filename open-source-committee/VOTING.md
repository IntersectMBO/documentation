# Committee Election Policies

## Introduction:

The purpose of this policy is to establish a structured voting and reelection cycle for the 9-member committee of
the Intersect Open-Source Committee (OSC). This proposed system aims to ensure a balance between continuity and renewal
within the committee, thus enhancing the overall effectiveness and stability of our organization.

## Implementation Method:

The following method and criteria are proposed for the (re)election of OSC members following a fairly common staggered
board method:

1. **Term:** All members of the OSC shall be elected for a period of service of one year. No member of the committee,
   except for bootstrapping members during the bootstrapping phase, may serve for a period of longer than
   one year without standing for re-election.
2. **Term Limits:** Given that members of the OSC should be elected to their position meritoriously based upon their
   contributions, there are no capped term limits currently imposed.
3. **Cohorts:** The membership of the committee should be broken up into three cohorts that face election cycles
   staggered throughout the year (one election every 4 months). This provides numerous benefits as detailed in the
   [rationale](#rationale-) below. The voting periods should be offset to begin held in February, June, and October
   in order to avoid the typical lulls in activity around summer and year's end holidays. Elections should be held,
   when possible, near the start of the month with the term of the next cohort beginning on the first day of the
   following month. This should allow members who were not reelected time to hand off or complete any unfinished tasks
   and for newly elected members to plan and adjust their schedules to meet their new obligations to the committee.

### Election Schedule for Cohorts
| Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sep | Oct | Nov | Dec |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|  -  |  A  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  B  |  -  |  -  |  -  |  C  |  -  |  -  |

4. **Nomination & Candidacy:** There should be a transparent and easy method for all interested parties to submit
   themselves (or be nominated) for candidacy in the next cohort election. The period for submitting candidacy (TBD)
   should be enough to allow eligible candidates time to attend *at least* one meeting of the committee to introduce
   themselves (if necessary) to the other members of the committee prior to voting. The *candidate forum meeting* may
   be a special (outside regular schedule) meeting of the committee in order to not detract from regular committee
   business.
   
### Election Cycle
| Period | Purpose                                                                  |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| n-2(?) | Candidacy nomination period opens                                        |
| n-1    | Special meeting of the committee for candidate introductions & questions |
| n      | Vote Held                                                                |
| n+1    | Retiring members hand off/complete outstanding tasks                     |
| n+2    | Newly appointed members onboarded to the committee                       |

5. **Election Method & Results:** The election method should follow *at least* the standard voting method adopted by
   the committee. Votes **must** use roll-call voting and results **must** be published via the committee's public
   communications channel(s).
    - **Ties & Run-Offs:** The method of resolving a tie or run-off scenario is currently TBD.
    - **Quorum:** A vote for candidates should only be considered valid if *at least* a simple majority of the duly
       elected (non-appointed or interim) members of the committee have participated in voting.
    - **Conflict of Interest:** No current member of the committee who is standing for reelection (incumbent) may
       participate in voting.
    - **Lack of Candidates:** Should a situation arise where there is a lack of eligible candidates standing in any
       given cohort election cycle (i.e. only 1 seat of 3 vacancies filled), the vacant seats may be appointed pursuant
       to the same terms of *abdication and vacancies*.

6. **Abdication & Vacancies:** Should a seat on the committee become vacated due to member resignation or abdication
   the empty seat may be appointed to an *interim term* via either special election or appointment by the sitting
   committee Chair person. An *interim term* shall begin from the date of appointment and continue until the next
   regular cohort election that the seat would regularly be subject to. Any individual currently serving an *interim
   term* shall be eligible to stand for reelection like any normal candidate.
    - Some proposed methods for filling vacant seats are as follows and *should* be considered by the committee prior to
      appointment of new members:
      - Runner(s) up from previous election cycles
      - A (brief) self-nomination period for interested members of the community
      - Nomination/referral from sitting, duly elected committee members
      - Appointment by the acting Chair

 > More points of order will likely need to be added here based upon feedback from the OSC community.

## Rationale:

The staggered board method proposed here provides a number of critical benefits that should allow the committee to
continuously operate effectively including:

* **Continuity and Stability:** By electing only one cohort of committee members every four months, the committee
  maintains a significant level of continuity and stability. This ensures that a majority of the committee is composed
  of experienced members who are familiar with the committee's operations, goals, and history. As a result, the
  committee can maintain a consistent strategic direction and avoid abrupt disruptions.

* **Preservation of Institutional Knowledge:** With staggered terms and limited turnover, institutional knowledge is
  preserved within the committee. Experienced members can pass on valuable information, lessons learned, and best
  practices to newer members, ensuring a smoother transition and a more effective committee.

* **Avoiding Stagnation:** Continuity should not be mistaken for stagnation. The four-month voting periods provide an
  opportunity for the organization to assess the performance of its committee members frequently. This encourages
  incumbents to remain proactive and responsive to the evolving needs of the organization.

* **Fresh Perspectives:** While maintaining experienced members, the staggered board method also injects fresh perspectives
  and new ideas into the committee regularly. This continuous infusion of new blood can prevent stagnation, encourage
  innovation, and help the organization adapt to changing circumstances and member needs.

* **Reduced Learning Curve:** New committee members have the opportunity to learn from their experienced counterparts,
  gradually easing into their roles. This reduces the learning curve and allows new members to become productive
  contributors more quickly. In a traditional annual election model, a complete overhaul of the committee can
  lead to disruptions and loss of institutional knowledge. By electing members in smaller batches over a period of
  time, we minimize the risk of abrupt transitions that can hinder the organization's progress.

* **Member Engagement:** Frequent elections and opportunities for members to participate in the voting process can
  enhance overall member engagement. Members are more likely to stay actively involved when they know their voices
  are heard regularly, leading to a more vibrant and participatory organization, which ultimately strengthens the
  organization's sense of community and shared purpose.

* **Balanced Accountability:** The staggered board method ensures that accountability is distributed evenly across
  the committee. With only one cohort being "new" at any given time, it becomes easier to assess individual and
  collective performance. This accountability helps maintain the committee's effectiveness and ensures that
  under-performing members can be addressed and replaced in a timely manner.

* **Consistent Leadership Transition:** The method provides a predictable and structured way for leadership
  transitions to occur. This reduces the potential for leadership vacuums and ensures that the organization always
  has a mix of experienced and newer leaders ready to take on responsibilities.

* **Flexibility:** In the event of unforeseen circumstances or challenges, the staggered board method allows the
  organization to adapt more readily. If specific committee members need to be replaced or if new leadership is
  required, the method provides a systematic way to do so without disrupting the entire committee.

In summary, the staggered board method combines the benefits of continuity and stability with the advantages of 
regular infusion of fresh perspectives and engagement. It is a well-balanced approach to committee governance that 
can contribute to the long-term success and resilience of a members-based organization.

## Conclusion:

In conclusion, implementing a voting and re-election cycle with three four-month voting periods for our open source
committee is a well-balanced approach that combines continuity and renewal. It ensures that the committee benefits 
from both experienced members and fresh perspectives while reducing the disruption caused by complete turnover. This 
system is designed to enhance the overall effectiveness, stability, and member engagement within our organization, 
ultimately contributing to its long-term success.
